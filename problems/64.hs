how does sqrt(23) work?

take out 4 - it's the largest integers < sqrt(23)

sqrt(23) = 4 + sqrt(23) - 4

invert the subtracted thing

= 4 + 1/(1/(sqrt(23) - 4))

multiply the numerator and denominator by sqrt(23) + 4

= 4 + 1/((sqrt(23) + 4)/(23 - 16))
= 4 + 1/((sqrt(23) + 4)/7)
= 4 + 1/(7/7 + (sqrt(23) - 3)/7)
= 4 + 1/(1 + (sqrt(23) - 3)/7)

so what's the operation?
I had sqrt(23) - 4

invert
multiply by sqrt(23) + 4
denominator is 23 - 4^2
